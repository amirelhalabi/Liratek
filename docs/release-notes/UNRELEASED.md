  LiraTek release notes — UNRELEASED (CLAUDE.md rule 30)

  Add ONE line per user-visible change, in the same change that makes it.
  - Group under "## <emoji> Area" headings (POS, Transactions, Profits, Suppliers / OMT, MTC / Alfa, …).
  - Write for shop owners and cashiers: what they now see or can do, and where. No ticket ids,
    no code terms. Say "web app" / "desktop app" when only one is affected.
  - Only what was really built; a fix for new entries says "from now on".
  - Tests, docs, CI and refactors with no behaviour change get no line.

  Highlights (optional, for a headline change — owner decisions 2026-10-03):
  put ONE "## ✨ Highlights" section at the very TOP of the file, above the grouped headings,
  holding 3-5 items, each written as:

    ### <Title>
    <One short paragraph.>
    ![<alt text>](whats-new/<version>/<file>.png)

  The image line is optional, but when present the file must already exist at
  frontend/public/whats-new/<version>/<file>.png — `node scripts/build-release-notes.cjs --check`
  FAILS the build if it's missing, or if the path isn't a plain relative whats-new/... path (no
  http(s)/data: URL, no ".." escape). Everything after the Highlights section is the normal
  grouped bullet list, unaffected by it. Highlight images must be .png (only PNG is supported) and
  ALWAYS LANDSCAPE (height smaller than width) — the card shows the whole image at card width, and
  the same --check FAILS, naming the file, on a portrait or square image. The in-app "What's new" renders Highlights as cards up
  top (with a "See all changes" toggle for the grouped list below); the WhatsApp copy
  (`yarn release-notes:whatsapp ...`) drops the images and turns each item into
  "• *Title*: sentence". A release with no Highlights section needs none of this — it renders
  exactly as before.

  `yarn release` moves everything below this comment into docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md. That file
  becomes the GitHub release body (shown by the desktop updater) and the in-app "What's new".
  WhatsApp copy: `yarn release-notes:whatsapp unreleased` (or a version).

## 💸 OMT / Whish & suppliers

- OMT account on the Suppliers page: a new check shows what OMT's balance SMS should say (your
  balance minus the commission OMT already deducted). Type the SMS figures to see any difference.

## 🧾 Transactions

- Refunding a currency exchange now works: the refund simply swaps the money back.
